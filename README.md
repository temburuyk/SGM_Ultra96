Overlay takes .bitstream .tcl and .hwh files generated by vivado project for writing the design to FPGA and accessing the IPs.

MGM_Overlay 		-> Computes the disparity in hardware with 5 sections bitstream and displays it on cv image 
					   (Zedcamera)
MGM_Overlay_Octomap -> Computes disparity for 1 frame calls octomap API for point cloud generation writing to .bt file
					   (Zedcamera)
MGM_Overlay2 		-> Computes the disparity in hardware with 9 sections bitstream and displays it on cv image
					   (Zedcamera)
MGM_Overlay3		-> Computes disparity for 1 frame calls octomap API for point cloud generation writing to .bt file
					   (Elpcamera)
